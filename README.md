# Paint-A-Reference REST API
This is the backend API database for my project. It contains four models: Users, Comments, Refs, Studies. It also includes fetching a third-party api from [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/) to upload images and create links.

Comments and studies are currently not being used and still under development.

## Refs
